## Projects
Undergraduate Researcher Summer 2022
University of North Carolina at Greensboro
PI: Dr. Thomas Weighill
- Description: During this REU, I worked on a project in topological data analysis. During this
project, we developed a novel way to detect spatial dependence using persistent homology in
comparison with the existing Moran’s I test. We looked at both theoretical and real data for our
research. I focused on the application into existing data. I was given North Carolina election data
by my supervisor, and I ran tests to see if there was any spatial correlation between Democratic
and Republican voting within NC counties. After we found results for NC data, we moved on to
national COVID data, looking for hotspots in COVID cases and deaths. It was found that our
method did find spatial dependence that Moran’s I did not. Our results were accepted for
publication in January 2023. We used Python and Jupyter Notebook to handle the data and write
our code. We then shared the code with each other using GitHub.
